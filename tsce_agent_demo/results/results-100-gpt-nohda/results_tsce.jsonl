{"id": 40, "kind": "formatting", "problem": "Remove every em-dash (—) from the following text while leaving other characters unchanged:\n\n---\nHere's a long-winded post—filled with em-dashes—stretching as far as I can take it—solely about how TSCE is not prompt engineering—all in one line: TSCE—despite its two-step approach to boosting AI reliability—should not be mistaken for prompt engineering—because—while prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responses—like carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queries—TSCE—as Kaleb described it—operates as a distinct methodology—potentially a backend algorithmic process—that might involve iterative validation of AI outputs—say—checking SQL queries against a database schema—or even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over time—rather than relying on the front-end input design that defines prompt engineering—which—according to web ID 2—centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intent—whereas TSCE could be a post-processing technique—perhaps analyzing AI-generated SQL for logical consistency—or a hybrid framework that integrates schema grounding—like web ID 2 mentions—without ever touching the prompt itself—meaning it’s more about refining the AI’s internal logic—possibly through a feedback loop—than about how the user phrases their request—which is the heart of prompt engineering—and furthermore—TSCE’s two-step nature might imply a systemic correction process—step one being the generation of an output—and step two being a validation or error-correction phase—completely independent of how the initial query was structured—unlike prompt engineering—which often requires iterative tweaking of the prompt itself
