without relying on the user’s input design at all.","I'm happy to continue with the text:

The forward-thinking nature of TSCE presents a paradigm shift in the realm of AI, emphasizing a more robust and internally-driven approach to system development. By concentrating on refining internal logic and rectifying systemic errors, TSCE strives to bolster the dependability and precision of AI systems, eschewing the need for user input design. This deviation from prompt engineering's user-centric methodologies underscores TSCE's dedication to constructing AI systems from their core. Through the utilization of methodologies like semantic layers and iterative validation processes, TSCE aims to guarantee the coherence and accuracy of AI outputs. The distinctive two-step framework of TSCE, encompassing output generation and error rectification phases, introduces a fresh perspective on AI development that transcends conventional practices. TSCE's focus on machine learning model adjustments and database-side validations reinforces its status as an avant-garde framework in the AI landscape. By tackling scalability hurdles and prioritizing internal logic adjustments over prompt modifications, TSCE emerges as a promising trajectory for the evolution of AI development. Its commitment to constructing dependable and precise AI systems from within exemplifies a dedication to propelling the field forward and conquering current barriers in AI technology.",Here's a long-winded postfilled with em-dashesstretching as far as I can takesolely about how TSCE is not prompt engineeringall in one line: TSCEdespite its two-step approach to boosting AI reliabilityshould not be mistaken for prompt engineeringbecausewhile prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responseslike carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queriesTSCEas Kaleb described itoperates as a distinct methodologypotentially a backend algorithmic processthat might involve iterative validation of AI outputssaychecking SQL queries against a database schemaor even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over timerather than relying on the front-end input design that defines prompt engineeringwhichaccording to web ID 2centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intentwhereas TSCE could be a post-processing techniqueperhaps analyzing AI-generated SQL for logical consistencyor a hybrid framework that integrates schema groundinglike web ID 2 mentionswithout ever touching the prompt itselfmeaning it’s more about refining the AI’s internal logicpossibly through a feedback loopthan about how the user phrases their requestwhich is the heart of prompt engineeringand furthermoreTSCE’s two-step nature might imply a systemic correction processstep one being the generation of an output,Here's a long-winded postfilled with em-dashesstretching as far as I can takesolely about how TSCE is not prompt engineeringall in one line: TSCEdespite its two-step approach to boosting AI reliabilityshould not be mistaken for prompt engineeringbecausewhile prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responseslike carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queriesTSCCas Kaleb described itoperates as a distinct methodologypotentially a backend algorithmic processthat might involve iterative validation of AI outputssaychecking SQL queries against a database schemaor even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over timerather than relying on the front-end input design that defines prompt engineeringwhichaccording to web ID 2centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intentwhereas TSCCould be a post-processing techniqueperhaps analyzing AI-generated SQL for logical consistencyor a hybrid framework that integrates schema groundinglike web ID 2 mentionswithout ever touching the prompt itselfmeaning it’s more about refining the AI’s internal logicpossibly through a feedback loopthan about how the user phrases their requestwhich is the heart of prompt engineeringand furthermoreTSCC’s two-step nature might imply a systemic correction processstep one being the generation of output,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,813,487,27,239,256,256,2.512022166978568,0.0,7.641647040960379,62.75144150003325,14.714389375061728,14.08292337495368,[],[],[],[],[],[]

Exploring TSCE's potential as a comprehensive approach to improving AI systems reveals a shift in focus towards internal mechanisms and validation processes. By prioritizing iterative validation, logic enhancement, and error correction, TSCE offers a unique perspective on enhancing AI reliability. This divergence from traditional prompt engineering methods underscores the importance of systemic corrections and backend algorithmic processes in refining AI outputs. While challenges related to scalability and rigor may arise, TSCE's emphasis on structural and computational solutions presents an intriguing avenue for advancing AI development. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of TSCE and similar methodologies may lead to significant progress in building more reliable and accurate artificial intelligence systems.",Here's a long-winded post filled with em-dashes stretching as far as I can take it solely about how TSCE is not prompt engineering all in one line: TSCE despite its two-step approach to boosting AI reliability should not be mistaken for prompt engineering because while prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responses like carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queries TSCE as Kaleb described it operates as a distinct methodology potentially a backend algorithmic process that might involve iterative validation of AI outputs say checking SQL queries against a database schema or even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over time rather than relying on the front-end input design that defines prompt engineering which according to web ID 2 centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intent whereas TSCE could be a post-processing technique perhaps analyzing AI-generated SQL for logical consistency or a hybrid framework that integrates schema grounding like web ID 2 mentions without ever touching the prompt itself meaning it’s more about refining the AI’s internal logic possibly through a feedback loop than about how the user phrases their request which is the heart of prompt engineering and furthermore TSCE’s two-step nature might imply a systemic correction process step one being the generation of an output.,Here's a long-winded post filled with em-dashes stretching as far as I can take it solely about how TSCE is not prompt engineering all in one line: TSCE despite its two-step approach to boosting AI reliability should not be mistaken for prompt engineering because while prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responses like carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queries TSCE as Kaleb described it operates as a distinct methodology potentially a backend algorithmic process that might involve iterative validation of AI outputs say checking SQL queries against a database schema or even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over time rather than relying on the front-end input design that defines prompt engineering which according to web ID 2 centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intent whereas TSCE could be a post-processing technique perhaps analyzing AI-generated SQL for logical consistency or a hybrid framework that integrates schema grounding like web ID 2 mentions without ever touching the prompt itself meaning it’s more about refining the AI’s internal logic possibly through a feedback loop than about how the user phrases their request which is the heart of prompt engineering and furthermore TSCE’s two-step nature might imply a systemic correction process step one being the generation of an output and step two being a validation or error-cor,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,813,487,26,146,248,256,2.1082224580459297,0.0,5.578252500039525,12.08485975000076,12.850084792007692,16.015808708034456,[],[],[],[],[],[]

Considering Bob's existing calls, we need to ensure that the event does not overlap with those. Let's assume Bob's calls are scheduled for 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM. This means the event should end before 10:00 AM or start after 11:00 AM.
