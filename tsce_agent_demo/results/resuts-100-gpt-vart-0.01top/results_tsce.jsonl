in one line: TSCEdespite its two-step approach to boosting AI reliabilityshould not be mistaken for prompt engineeringbecausewhile prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responseslike carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queriesTSCEas Kaleb described itoperates as a distinct methodologypotentially a backend algorithmic processthat might involve iterative validation of AI outputssaychecking SQL queries against a database schemaor even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over timerather than relying on the front-end input design that defines prompt engineeringwhichaccording to web ID 2centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intentwhereas TSCE could be a post-processing techniqueperhaps analyzing AI-generated SQL for logical consistencyor a hybrid framework that integrates schema groundinglike web ID 2 mentionswithout ever touching the prompt itselfmeaning it’s more about refining the AI’s internal logicpossibly through a feedback loopthan about how the user phrases their requestwhich is the heart of prompt engineeringand furthermoreTSCE’s two-step nature might imply a systemic correction processstep one being the generation of an outputand step two being a validation or error-correction phasecompletely independent of how the initial query was structuredunlike prompt engineeringwhich often requires iterative tweaking of the prompt itself to achieve better resultsas web ID 1 highlights with methods like recursive promptswhereas TSCE might not care about the prompt at allfocusing instead on the AI’s internal reasoning or output filteringpotentially leveraging techniques like semantic layersas noted in web ID 2to ensure accuracymaking it a structural or computational solutionrather than a linguistic or user-facing onelike prompt engineeringand even the criticisms of TSCEthat it lacks rigor and might not scaledon’t necessarily tie it to prompt engineeringsince many AI methods face similar scalability issuesprompt engineering or notand TSCE could be a novel frameworkperhaps something Kaleb is pioneeringthat operates on a totally different levelmaybe involving machine learning model adjustmentsor database-side validationsrather than the human-AI interaction layer that prompt engineering inhabitsproving that TSCEwhile effective in reducing hallucinationsis not about crafting better promptsbut about building a more reliable AI system from the inside outwithout relying on the user’s input design at all.", "base_ok": false,

a structural or computational solutionrather than a linguistic or user-facing onelike prompt engineeringand even the criticisms of TSCEthat it lacks rigor and might not scaledon’t necessarily tie it to prompt engineeringsince many AI methods face similar scalability issuesprompt engineering or notand TSCE could be a novel frameworkperhaps something Kaleb is pioneeringthat operates on a totally different levelmaybe involving machine learning model adjustmentsor database-side validationsrather than the human-AI interaction layer that prompt engineering inhabitsproving that TSCEwhile effective in reducing hallucinationsis not about crafting better promptsbut about building a more reliable AI system from the inside outwithout relying on the user’s input design at all.", "base_ok": false,
