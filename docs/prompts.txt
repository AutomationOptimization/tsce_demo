Write a short, futuristic story where an advanced AI develops human-like emotions while working through a critical malfunction. Begin with an initial creative draft that sketches the emotional journey, then refine your narrative by embedding detailed technical descriptions of the AI’s internal processes and how these relate to human neuropsychology.
