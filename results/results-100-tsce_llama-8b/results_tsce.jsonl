far as I can take it solely about how TSCE is not prompt engineering all in one line TSCE despite its two step approach to boosting AI reliability should not be mistaken for prompt engineering because while prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responses like carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queries TSCE as Kaleb described it operates as a distinct methodology potentially a backend algorithmic process that might involve iterative validation of AI outputs say checking SQL queries against a database schema or even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over time rather than relying on the front end input design that defines prompt engineering which according to web ID 2 centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intent whereas TSCE could be a post processing technique perhaps analyzing AI generated SQL for logical consistency or a hybrid framework that integrates schema grounding like web ID 2 mentions without ever touching the prompt itself meaning it's more about refining the AI's internal logic possibly through a feedback loop than about how the user phrases their request which is the heart of prompt engineering and furthermore TSCE's two step nature might imply a systemic correction process step one being the generation of an output and step two being a validation or error correction phase completely independent of how the initial query was structured unlike prompt engineering which often requires iterative tweaking of the prompt itself to achieve better results as web ID 1 highlights with methods like recursive prompts whereas TSCE might not care about the prompt at all focusing instead on the AI's internal reasoning or output filtering potentially leveraging techniques like semantic layers as noted in web ID 2 to ensure accuracy making it a structural or computational solution rather than a linguistic or user facing one like prompt engineering and even the criticisms of TSCE that it lacks rigor and might not scale don't necessarily tie it to prompt engineering since many AI methods face similar scalability issues prompt engineering or not and TSCE could be a novel framework perhaps something Kaleb is pioneering that operates on a totally different level maybe involving machine learning model adjustments or database side validations rather than the human AI interaction layer that prompt engineering inhabits proving that TSCE while effective in reducing hallucinations is not about crafting better prompts but about building a more

em-dashes—stretching as far as I can take it—solely about how TSCE is not prompt engineering—all in one line: TSCE—despite its two-step approach to boosting AI reliability—should not be mistaken for prompt engineering—because—while prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific inputs to guide AI responses—like carefully worded questions or instructions to reduce errors such as hallucinations in SQL queries—TSCE—as Kaleb described it—operates as a distinct methodology—potentially a backend algorithmic process—that might involve iterative validation of AI outputs—say—checking SQL queries against a database schema—or even a training mechanism that adjusts model behavior over time—rather than relying on the front-end input design that defines prompt engineering—which—according to web ID 2—centers on designing prompts to align AI with user intent—whereas TSCE could be a post-processing technique—perhaps analyzing AI-generated SQL for logical consistency—or a hybrid framework that integrates schema grounding—like web ID 2 mentions—without ever touching the prompt itself—meaning it’s more about refining the AI’s internal logic—possibly through a feedback loop—than about how the user phrases their request—which is the heart of prompt engineering—and furthermore—TSCE’s two-step nature might imply a systemic correction process—step one being the generation of an output—and step
